To analyze the impact of mobility and multipath propagation on wireless communication by computing Doppler spread, coherence time, delay spread, and coherence bandwidth under different scenarios, please follow the following steps:

### Case 01
  1) Input the Distance between transmitter and receiver (r), Velocity of receiver (v) (can be negative if moving away), and Carrier frequency (f).
  2) Observe the changes in doppler spread and coherence time with a change in the input parameters.

### Case 02
  1) Input the Distance between transmitter and receiver (r), Distance between transmitter and obstacle (d), and Carrier frequency (f).
  2) Observe the changes in delay spread and coherence bandwidth with a change in the input parameters.

### Case 03
  1) Repeat the above steps for a different set of inputs for both Doppler and delay spread.
  2) Compare and analyze the results by observing how mobility and multipath affect wireless performance.
