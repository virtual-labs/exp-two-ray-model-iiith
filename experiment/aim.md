This experiment provides basic understanding of multi-paths of wireless channel and how they effect the received signal using two ray model.

The objective is to characterize the various properties of wireless channel including Doppler spread, coherence time, delay spread, coherence bandwidth for a two-ray model via the examples of the following scenarios:
1) Free space with fixed receive antenna
2) Free space with moving receive antenna
3) Reflecting wall with fixed receive antenna
4) Reflecting wall with moving receive antenna
