      "question": "If a transmitter sends a sinusoidal signal with a frequency of 1 MHz and the receiver is placed 300 meters away from the transmitter in free space, what will be the time delay for the signal to reach the receiver? (Speed of light = 3×10^8 m/s)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "0.01 × 10^-6 sec",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – this would be too small for 300 m.",
        "b": "Correct – delay = 300 / (3×10^8) = 1 × 10^-6 s.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct – distance = 100 + (10 × 5) = 150 m.",
        "b": "Incorrect – this would require a speed of 20 m/s.",
        "c": "Incorrect – 120 m corresponds to 4 m/s.",
