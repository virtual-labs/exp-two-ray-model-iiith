      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – this parameter is not solely determined by the transmitter.",
        "b": "Correct – α(θ, φ, f) represents channel characteristics as a function of direction and frequency.",
        "c": "Incorrect – the receiver does not define this property.",

      "question": "What is coherence time?",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – that is propagation delay, not coherence time.",
        "b": "Correct – coherence time is the duration the channel remains approximately constant.",
        "c": "Incorrect – phase shift zero-crossing is unrelated to coherence time definition.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – it depends on the channel, not the transmitted waveform itself.",
        "b": "Correct – coherence bandwidth is determined by the channel’s multipath spread.",
        "c": "Incorrect – receiver design does not change the channel’s intrinsic property.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct – longer delay spreads result in smaller coherence bandwidth.",
        "b": "Incorrect – the relationship is inverse.",
        "c": "Incorrect – delay spread does not directly increase coherence time.",
        "d": "Incorrect – coherence time relates to Doppler spread, not delay spread."

      "question": "How does a larger delay spread affect the coherence bandwidth?",

        "a": "Incorrect – delay spread and coherence bandwidth are inversely related.",
        "b": "Correct – larger delay spread reduces the coherence bandwidth.",
        "c": "Incorrect – there is a clear dependence.",

        "d": "..a sinusoid with constant amplitude"

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – while exponential decay appears in some models, it’s not the general Doppler spectrum result.",
        "b": "Correct – Jakes' model shows sinusoidal variation with a decaying envelope due to Doppler spread.",
        "c": "Incorrect – there is a defined statistical form for typical fading channels.",
        "d": "Incorrect – fading causes amplitude decay, not constant amplitude."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct – extra path = 200 - 150 = 50 m; delay = 50 / (3×10^8) ≈ 0.167 μs.",
        "b": "Incorrect – ms scale is far too large for this distance.",

        "a": "Correct – RMS delay spread ≈ 1 μs → coherence bandwidth ≈ 1 / (2 × 1 μs) = 0.5 MHz.",
        "b": "Incorrect – bandwidth cannot be negative.",
