      "question": "What is the Doppler shift when the receiver is moving towards the source?",

        "a": "positive",
        "b": "negative",
        "c": "zero",
        "d": "constant"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Yes, the Doppler shift is positive when the receiver is moving towards the source.",
        "b": "The doppler shift is neagive only hen the reciever is moving away from the source.",
        "c": "Doppler shift is zero when the receiver is not moving.",
        "d": "Doppler shift is not constant."

      "question": " How does a larger delay spread affect the coherence bandwidth?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It increases the coherence bandwidth",
        "b": "It decreases the coherence bandwidth",
        "c": "It has no effect on the coherence bandwidth",
        "d": "It makes the coherence bandwidth constant"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "delay spead and coherence bandwidth are inversely proportional. So, a larger delay spread increases the coherence bandwidth.",
        "b": "Yes, a larger delay spread decreases the coherence bandwidth.",
        "c": "Delay spread and coherence bandwidth are inversely proportional. So, a larger delay spread increases the coherence bandwidth.",

      "question": " In a scenario where a direct path has a length of 150 meters and the reflected path has a length of 200 meters, calculate the delay spread.",
      "answers": {
        "a": "0.167\u03BCs",
        "b": "1.67ms",
        "c": "1.67\u03BCs",
        "d": "0.167ms"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Yes, this is correct. The delay spread is the difference in time between the direct and reflected paths. The difference is 50 meters, which is 0.167\u03BCs.",
        "b": "The delay spread is the difference in time between the direct and reflected paths. The difference is 50 meters, which is 0.167\u03BCs.",
